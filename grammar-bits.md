# Verbs

Kois verbs are simple, perhaps too simple. There are four tenses: imperative, past, present, future.

* Present -> Subject + Verb
* Past -> Subject + Verb + ba
* Future -> Subject + Verb + re
* Imperative -> Verb + e

## Examples: 

- ekompar - I buy
- eWilBa - I wanted
- du Kompar - You are buying
